Note that the inefficiency comes from using the CPU. 

If we use CPU depedendent operations such as calculations, then using Threads on 2 computational heavy 
functions would slow down the code! 


Instead, for operations such as prompting for an User Input and we want to run a one computationally heavy process,
then Threads is recommended!
